{{WOS}}{{Quote|In this form you have extreme powers, Master Mario!|[[Toadsworth]], when introducing God Mario in Mario &amp; Luigi: The Legendary Bros.}}
God Mario is a one of the few forms that Mario could obtain without eating an [[Mushroom]] or [[Flower]].

God Mario was the form Mario used to create the Mario Megaverse.

The form is accessed when Mario's god meter in [[Mario &amp; Luigi: The Legendary Bros.]] (also known as Mario &amp; Luigi: Hax Bros.) gets full. The meter gets filled by collecting coins and defeating enemies. It is possible to load the meter significantly when you eat food items sold in stores. It turns Mario into his god form, and is able to shoot strong energy beams at enemies and is an instant kill move. The player has to press 1 to start the form and the player will have to go to the inventory and get the Enchanted Stone to turn Mario back. The form lasts until Mario touches The Enchanted Stone. Mario is able to take one out from his &quot;Important Items&quot; inventory. The Enchanted Stone is given to Mario by [[Toadsworth]] so Mario could change back to his normal form.[[File:New_God_Mario_Concept_art.png|thumb|This is God Mario's early concept art.]]

Without touching The Enchanted Stone however, it lasts forever. It was hinted by the book by this line: &quot;The Legendary Status of The Hero of Light will last until an ancient artifact comes in physical contact. Nothing else will do.&quot; If you haven't known yet, the &quot;Legendary Status&quot; is Mario's god form, &quot;The Hero of Light&quot; is Mario, and finally, &quot;an Ancient Artifact&quot; is The Enchanted Stone.[[File:God_mario_yogioh.png|thumb|Here is the YuGiOh card of God Mario. It is created by the King of Logic.]]
==Feats==
Here are a number of feats God Mario (one with Luigi) had done in the cutscenes of the game &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: The Legendary Bros&quot;, all of the following feats happened either in cutscenes in the real game or in the Super Mario-Kun manga version of the game:
*Mario derailed a terrestrial planet the size of Jupiter then easily threw it onto Giant [[Bowser]], smashing the planet into trillions of pieces.
*God Mario and [[Starman]] [[Luigi]] spinned so fast that with their combined force, it sucked a megaverse in along with Bowser, and it became an unsteady ball of white energy then it got trapped in the middle of the spinning duo's circle and eventually, it exploded, destroying the megaverse along with it. It was the only way to defeat Bowser.
*Flew so fast that Mario crossed a galaxy in seconds. Being 31,556,823,811 times faster than light.
*Created a ball of fire that melted all the snow on a mountain without even physical contact and then evaporated all the water in the Goomba Planet's ocean and then said &quot;That was not even a warm up!&quot; to Luigi.
*God Mario summoned magical beings such as the Star Spirits and gave them enough energy to defy the Star Rod at it's best.
*God Mario was seen turning giant suns into little star ornaments in order to disable Bowser's Energy Generator.
*Made powerups once with his own power to give [[Luigi]].
*Took an omniverse collapsing and exploding on him and came out of it without even a scratch.
*Granting people's good-hearted wishes
*Mario (especially in his god form) Keeps the Mario Megaverse together, without him, it will fall apart, then eventually, it will be destroyed. Stated by [[Rosalina]] in the Super Mario-Kun version of the game. Legend has it, that the power Mario emits is the survival of the megaverse. To give you a taste about the Mario megaverse, here it is:
{{Quote|The marioverse is composed of multiple places seen in many games that can vary greatly(The most well know place is usually the mushroom kingdom)and has 22 separate universes known (25 if you count the alternate versions of the Mushroom universe) who some of them are reunited into 4+ multiverses (Paper Mario's Multiverse/All worlds, Mario Galaxy's Multiverse, DK's Multiverse, Mario RPG's multiverse and others), thus making the Marioverse a Megaverse.|From a Mario respect post.}}

==Gameplay Controls==
The Game &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: The Legendary Brothers&quot; is playable in two consoles. The [[Wii]] and the [[3DS]]. Thus having two sets of controls.
*Press 1 to shoot energy beams and hold 1 and use the control pad or the nunchucks to aim and if the crosshair goes aims at an enemy, it will turn red. When the player presses A, it will deliver a powerful beam to the enemy and instantly destroying it.
*Shake the [[Wii Remote]] or the [[3DS]] while in midair to fly. But instead of moving automatically, you will stay at one place. Use the control pad or nunchucks to move. Press A to land.
*You can not destroy an enemy just by running into it like the [[Starman]] but when Mario runs into an enemy, he will automatically sent a shock to the enemy and kill it.
*You don't need to waste your time fighting the enemy like in your base form. Instead, you can just skip the battle with a beam or a shock.
*If you go into looking mode with the Wii Remote pad or tap &quot;Looking Mode&quot; in the touchscreen of the 3DS, you can aim while you are looking. Just hold 1 and do the same thing.
==Abilities and Powers==
The only usable move of God Mario is energy beam. But the Book of All Knowledge said that God Mario's durability even gets higher than his base durability which is already powerful enough to survive an Megaverse destroying move with ease. The book also said that Mario's strength becomes godly, enough to easily pull a planet out of it's orbit and throw it at incredible speeds.

The book also mentioned some of God Mario's moves are such as time stop, slow, or acceleration, and in a cutscene, Mario in his god form was shown turning suns into little star ornaments.  The book also said that God Mario can make any wishes of anybody or anything come true. The form can be only used by the leader and the most powerful of the [[Star Children]], Mario. Because the Star Children (Mario especially) have godly powers.

==Abilities in Gameplay==
*Able to smash through previously indestructible enemies (e.g. [[Thwomp]]).
*Able to reflect electricity type attacks.
*Ability to walk through any kind of force field or elemental shield.
*In this form, Mario could absorb any kind of elemental properties, such as fire, plasma, electricity (non projectile), dark matter, and any kind of energy you encounter in the game.
*When after dark matter gets absorbed by Mario, it will make Mario run faster and look more purple for a short while.
*As I have said, God Mario has the ability to shoot beams in normal or looking mode.
*Ability to fly very fast.
*Boost while sprinting or flying with C, Mario could run/fly faster. (Will leave a trail of gold energy that will defeat enemies).
*God Mario has the ability to uncover hidden stuff when he gets into range. (Like [[Bulb Yoshi]] in Super Mario Galaxy 2).
*Walk through breakable objects just by touching it.
*Magic and curses have no effect on God Mario.
*Fully enlight a dark place (e.g. A mansion) like a [[Starman]] Mario could in [[New Super Mario Bros. Series]].
==Appearance==
Mario's God form gives him white overalls, a golden shirt underneath, a golden hat and a golden cape similar to [[Cape Mario]]. Golden sparks and an aura represents that of Mario having more power than he could contain. Sometimes, when he walks, sparks jump out of the ground!

==Quotes==
{{Quote|That was not even a warm up!|Mario after evaporating an entire ocean and more.}}

{{Quote|In this form you have extreme powers, Master Mario!|Toadsworth}}

{{Quote|Without your power, everything will collapse, destroying everything, including existence itself!|Rosalina in Super Mario-Kun (Mostly talking about base Mario).}}

{{Quote|Mario... Without his power, all of existence will collapse, and it will get explode eventually. With that clue, the ancients knew that it was Mario who created all of existence (Mario Megaverse). With his power, he could also revive it...|The Book of all Knowledge|Note: Just to recap, the Ancients were also the ones that created the Book of All Knowledge, they made it look like the Light Prognosticus.}}

{{Quote|(Groans) I envy my brother! Why does he get all those cool powers?|Luigi, envying Mario's awesome potential.}}

==Trivia==
*In the game &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 3: Arrival of the Dark King&quot; a [[Luma]] in a hidden area referred to God Mario by saying &quot;You would surely could do a lot in your ''Ultimate Form.&quot; '' A reference to God Mario.
*There are two forms that grants Mario golden stature and sparks. The other form is [[Golden Mario|Gold Mario.]] It allows Mario to throw golden fireballs that could turn brick blocks and enemies into golden coins. But instead of a golden aura, Gold Mario is made entirely out of golden energy.
*Though not told in its starring game, God Mario is said to be potentially omnipotent and is the most powerful thing in the entire Nintendoverse, even maybe the video game universe. It is said in the trophy gallery of Super Smash Bros. Brawl 2.
*In the trophy gallery it also said &quot;...With Mario possessing infinite power.&quot; Another statement to show God Mario's omnipotence.
*The trophy of God Mario is the rarest trophy that could be obtained in Super Smash Bros. Brawl 2. The only way to obtain it is to beat the &quot;Boss Battles&quot; mode in insane difficulty with only one stock. After that, a challenger appears, being Dark Mario. When you beat them all, you will be rewarded with the trophy and Dark Mario will become a playable character.
*[[God Waluigi]] is irrelivant, that is because God Mario is created first. And the game specifically said that it was God Mario who created the multiverse.

      <comment>/* Mushroom Kingdom */clean up</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2133">{{delete}}Dark Land is Bowser's Kingdom. It has high volcanic activity. The [[Koopa Troopa]]s and [[Goomba]]'s live there.
==History==
After [[Bowser]], the [[Koopa Troop]], [[King Koopa (Super Mario Bros. Super Show!)]], and the [[Koopa Pack]] attempted to overthrow the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]'s government in Super Mario Bros, The Super Mario Bros Super Show, and Super Mario 64 [[Princess Peach]] banished them to Dark Land. In the volcanic world Bowser and King Koopa made a deal and they formed two kingdoms. If you wan't to hear more about the kingdom King Koopa ruled until he died see [[Dark Land 2]].

==Government==
The government is an absolute monarchy and Bowser has complete power to declare whatever he want's.

===Economy===

The major economy of Dark Land is joining the [[Koopa Troop]]. 50% of the male citizens join Bowsers army. They import their food and drinks from Subcon. The 50% of the males that don't join the army and the females get jobs like maintaining the money and selling food, drinks, toys and clothes. Many of their products including toys are made in U.C. In fact they are labeled &quot;Made in U.C&quot;.
==Allies==
===Dark Land 2===

Up until [[Super Mario RPG the quest of koopa]] Dark Land 1 and Dark Land 2 were allies. Dark Land 1's [[Koopa Troop]] often joined forces with Dark Land 2's [[Koopa Pack]].  
==[[U.C. Empire]]==
 During the [[Mushroom Revolutionary War]] the Koopa Tribes and the Goomba's joined forces with the U.C army mainly because U.C treated them better. As I said earlier they get their food, drinks, clothing, toys, and other product from U.C.
==Enemies==
===Mushroom Kingdom===

Because of treating them badly for years Dark Land and the Mushroom Kingdom are enemies. They compete with the Mushroom Kingdom in Sporting events. However Bowser has a crush on the [[Mushroom King]]'s daughter [[Princess Peach]] so the grudge against the royal family is finally starting to settle down. However Peach doesn't like Bowser because he still is mean to the [[Mushroom People]].

'''Super Mario Galaxy 3 The Grand Journey''' is the third Super Mario Galaxy game going to be released in 2013 on the [[Wii U]]. It was created by a wikia contributor who joined Fantendo. It can be 1 to 4 players. Player 1 is Mario but the others can choose who to pick.
==Story==
[[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Wario]], and [[Waluigi]] are invited to the third star festival. They walk through Toad Town and enter the castle (which the inside has a similar look as it did in Super Mario 64). Mario goes to see Peach. Then all of a sudden there is a big crashing sound that brew a hole in the roof and knocked Mario out. Mario saw 8 airships. One was big and the other 7 were the mini ones the [[Koopalings]] used in New Super Mario Bros U. They were attacking [[Toad Town]]. Then chains drop from the airships as they lift up Peach's castle and take it to space. Mario stood there shocked. Then he walks around the Toad Town seeing the Toads panicking saying stuff like &quot;Its Bowser and the Koopalings!&quot; &quot;Why [[Bowser]] why?! This is the third time you ruined our star festival!&quot; Mario finds [[Baby Luma]] who explained that the comet observatory was attacked by 7 UFOs and it absorbed all the power stars and kidnapped his mama [[Rosalina]]. He then warps into Mario's cap and another luma transforms into a [[Launch Star]]. Mario launches into space. Then he goes through the first galaxy which is called the Rainbow Road Galaxy. After finding the first Power Star in the game it takes him to where a door of a starship opens. When Mario gets in the door closes. Then he finds a bunch of [[Luma]]s and an astronaut called (whoever the [[Mii]] you picked for your save file is). The Astronaut explains that the ship is called the Miiship and how a spiky dragon turtle on an airship attacked and stole the power stars from the ship. Then he or she thanks Mario for finding the first grand star. Then the Mii Captain drives the starship to where the 8 airships are in space. Mario then launches to get to the first airship.
==[[Larry Koopa]]'s airship==
The first airship. You travel through it and battle Larry. You get the second power star the miiship needs.
==[[Morton Koopa Jr.]]s airship==
The second airship. You travel through it and battle Morton. You get the third power star the Miiship needs.
==[[Wendy O. Koopa]]'s airship==
The third airship. You travel through it and battle Wendy. You get the fourth power star the Miiship needs.
==[[Iggy Koopa]]'s airship==
The fourth airship. You travel through it and battle Iggy. You get the fifth power star the Miiship needs.
==[[Roy Koopa]]'s airship==
The fifth airship. You travel through it and battle Roy. You get the sixth power star the Miiship needs.
==This article is still under construction. Do not edit without my permission unless it's spelling and grammar. And don't worry the adventure Mario will do will be much bigger than this. I am still thinking of ideas==
==[[Lemmy Koopa]]'s airship==
The sixth airship. You travel through it and battle Lemmy. You get the seventh power star the Miiship needs.
==[[Ludwig von Koopa]]'s airship==
The seventh airship and the final one before Bowser's. You travel through it and battle Ludwig. You get the eighth power star the Miiship needs.
==Bowser's Airship==
The final airship. Thats were you have to find the grand star. You travel through it and then you battle Bowser and [[Bowser Jr.]] After that you get the grand star. Then all of a sudden the Ufos Baby Luma described arrived. They absorbed the power stars and grand stars Bowser stolen from the Miiship. They also took Princess Peach. Bowser shouted at the aliens &quot;Hey BACK OFF!!!!! Kidnapping Princess Peach is MY JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; An alien voice from one of the Ufos said back &quot;We need the Princess and we need to brainwash her to bake a cake so our boss [[Tatanga]] can use the cake she baked for his master plan. Ha Ha Ha Ha!&quot;. Then they suck up everyone exept Mario and launch lasers at the airships making everything fall in all directions.
==Planet Luma==
Princess Peach's castle gets caught in the gravity of a planet called planet Luma. It then falls on another castle and destroys it. Then Mario finds a Luma crying. The Luma says &quot;I am [[Prince Luma IV]] son of [[King Luma III]]. When that castle fell on the castle beneath it killed my sniff f f f father! Nooooooo Father Nooooooo!!! Then fury is in his eyes as he turns to Mario. &quot;You will pay!&quot; He shouted. Then there is a mini battle. After jumping on him 5 times Mario says something. Then Prince Luma IV said &quot;Oh! Aliens atacked that castle and those airships in space! Sorry for accusing you of intentionally doing that. I bet Tatanga is behind all of this. One of our Luma spies traveled to his space station and came back reporting that Tatanga wants to kidnap the Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom because he wants to force her to bake a cake for him. I know it seems rediculous that an alien would order his henchmen to atack airships in space and kidnap a princess just for a cake but I think he has a much bigger plot. He wants her magical cake probbably because her famous magical cakes might help him complete his evil master plan. I don't know what his master plan is yet.&quot;  Then Baby Luma comes out of Mario's cap. Then Prince Luma said &quot;Oh is that.... is that Y Y Young Master Luma. Wait a minute! If you have the trust of Young Master Luma that means you have the power to breathe in space and save your special one. Master Luma how did you get here. Arn't you from Rosalina's comet observatory?&quot;. Baby Luma answered that the aliens attacked it, kidnapped his mother Rosalina, and stole the power stars and grand stars. Then Prince Luma finds the crown and puts it on his head. He said with a microphone to the Luma citizens of Luma city. &quot;My people. I King Luma IV declare that I need help fixing this destroyed castle. Can you do it?&quot; The Lumas cheer &quot;Yeah!&quot; They fix the castle and it was just as good as new. Peach's castle and the Miiship is fixed as well. Then King Luma IV explains &quot;If you collect 70 stars that starhip will combine with your special ones castle and you can drive it to the center of the universe. That is where Tatanga's Spacestation is. You unlocked this room's launch star in your castle. Go in there. Once you 10 power stars there you can unlock the next room's launch star.&quot; Then the adventure began. Each world was unlocked in each room. The first room unlocked would bring you to World 1.

Super Mario Bros 30th anniversary edition is a remake of the original 1985 Super Mario Bros. It is released in 2015 and celebrates the 30th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. The graphics are advanced into Wii U graphics and there are many cutscenes. It was created by a wikia contributor mainly because he didn&amp;apos;t like that [[Super Mario Bros 2010]] didn&amp;apos;t follow the storyline and gameplay of Super Mario Bros.
==Story==
[[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] are in Brooklyn at their Mario Bros Plumbing place. Then they get a call from a lady that needed plumbing help on a drain. The Mario Bros came to her house and started working on it then all of a sudden they get sucked down through a warp pipe into the Mushroom Kingdom. Meanwhile [[King Koopa]] cornered [[Princess Peach]] and [[Toad]] on a cliff ready to kidnap them. Then the Mario Brothers came barreling out of a pipe and knocked a bunch of [[Koopa Troopa]]s that were in the [[Koopa Pack]]. King Koopa jumped

It is considered to be in the Super Mario Series and it takes place on the timeline soon before the events of New Super Mario Bros Wii. 

==Plot==

The Mushroom King invites [[Mario]] to his birthday festival. While on the way Mario finds Master Luma on the ground. He says he was napping on the Comet Observatory and woke up in the Mushroom Kingdom. Master Luma warp into Mario's cap. When Mario arrives at Peach's castle he see's [[Bowser Jr]] and his airships attacking. [[Peach]] is in the main one. Bowser Jr said with a sinister grin on his face &quot;Hee Hee Hee!!!!!! Ha Ha Ha!!!!!!!! Your to late Mario. I stole all the Presents and I am helping my dad take over not only the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] but Dinosaur Land too. He has the power of the stars and you don't stand a chance! So long you stupid Plumber!&quot; Bowser Jr's airships lifts up Peach's Castle and fly away. A Koopa Troopa says &quot;Quick! Jump in the portal and it will take you to Dinosaur Land. There Mario travels through the first Level called The Gateway to Dinosaur Land. Mario battles a giant Goomba and finds the first power star. That takes him to King Koopa's Doomship. [[King Koopa]] (Super Mario Bros. Super Show!)]] &quot;Mario I know we have been enemies since the Super Mario Bros Super Show but we have too team up to defeat my cousin [[Bowser]] and his bratty son [[Bowser Jr.]]. They attacked this Doomship with their airships and stole our power stars. See that's our fuel. Without it were stranded here. Thanks for bringing this Power Star. Wait if you have the trust of Master Luma say maybe you can help us collect the Power Stars and Grand Stars. Many of my Koopa Pack members will help you along your way. You can talk too them and ask for help. Make sure you don't confuse them with the Koopa Troopa's that work for Bowser. What are you waiting for?! Don't just stand there, MOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; During the journey Mario collects a Power Star at the end of each level allowing the Doomship to advane and move farther. He collects a grand star after each world. The end of each World is a Castle where a boss is battled after traveling through. Here are the Worlds.

==World 1 Yoshi's Island==

The Island where Mario unlocks Yoshi. It has a lot of plants and animals that Yoshi eats. The World Castle Boss is [[Dark Yoshi]].
==World 2 Donut Land==

A world of Donuts. The World Castle Boss is [[King Donut]].

==World 3 The Twin Bridges==

The Cheese and Butter Bridges. The World Castle Boss is [[The Stinky Cheese Man]].

==World 4 Cookie Mountain==

A mountain of cookies. The World Castle Boss is [[ The Cookie King]].

==World 5 The Forest of Illusion==

An enchanted forest. The World Castle Boss is [[King Boo]].

==World 6 The Valley of Bowser==

The Creepy Cave that Bowser named after himself. The World Castle Boss is Bowser Jr

==Bowser Main Castle==

After finding a lot the Power Stars and Grand Stars the Doomship flies out on Dinosuar Land to Bowsers Castle in the volcanic [[DarkLand]] Bowser is battled at first in his Regular size in the &quot;Koopa Clown Car&quot; but after getting deafeated the first time Bowser eats a grand star and grows huge. After getting deafeated the second time he say's &quot;No you have deafeated me. But someday I'll return. Maybe even on Princess Peach's upcoming Birthday next week. Why did you help King Koopa. He is a double crossing cheater. I was tricked into training his 7 children Ludwig, Roy, Morton, Wendy, Lemmy, Iggy and Larry to become criminals because he said I would get over $9000 million as a reward but it was all a lie. You are stupid Mario if you can be tricked into teaming up with your cartoon nemises instead of your video game nemises&quot;. Then Bowser sank into the lava. Peach gets out of the cage and say's thank you for not only saving me but saving my Kingdom and Dinosaur Land. Here take this grand star. After collecting the grand star and cellebrating they return to King Koopa's doomship.
==The true final boss==
Back on the Doomship King Koopa says &quot;You have found the final grand star. Thank you for helping me with my evil plan to take over the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] and Dinosaur Land. Normally this Doomship runs on oil but to save money I stole the Power Stars from Rosalina's comet observatory. I will use then to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom, Dinosaur Land, The other countries in the Mushroom World, and possibly the Universe. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!! Then King Koopa locks Peach in a room and throws [[Mario]] off the doomship. Suddenly [[Rosalina]] appears 
out of nowhere and saves Mario. Mario starts to float. She says &quot;That [[King Koopa]]. I hate him even more then I hate [[Bowser]]. Tricking you like that. Stealing our Power Stars. Seperating me from my precious little one. I even feel sympathy for Bowser after all those years of helping King Koopa gets double crossed. I will help you fight.&quot; They return to the doomship. The Koopalings are having a conversation with King Koopa. Ludwig says &quot;King Dad why did you double cross your cousin Bowser. He trained us how to become ultimate criminals.&quot; King Koopa says &quot;He was a nuisance to be around back when we were kids. Why shouldn't I?&quot; Then King Koopa ate all the power stars, and grand stars and grows into koopzilla size. Then Mario and Rosalina get into a huge battle with King Koopa. Then when King Koopa is about to step on Mario and Squash him Rosalina says &quot;King Koopa you tricked this innocent man into thinking those power stars were rightfully yours. Your Game shall end!&quot; Rosalina launches magic power from her wand at King Koopa. The green koopa breaks into pieces and gets sucked into a black hole to the Underwhere. Rosalina say's &quot;Thank you Mario for helping me battle this evil King Koopa. Feel Free to visit the bonus world anytime you want too.&quot; Then the credits come. A cutscene after the credits show the doomship falling onto Bowser's castle. Bowser said to the Koopalings &quot;Even though King Koopa tricked me I still miss him. In fact I will adopt all of you. I have another villianous plan that is going to happen on Princess Peach's birthday. Maybe you can help me.&quot; The koopalings say &quot;Yes King Bowser&quot; Bowser and Bowser Jr say &quot;Yes!&quot; 
==Bonus Special World 9 Star Haven== High above the Mushroom Kingdom and even Sky Land up in outer space you can travel down rainbow road, collect more stars, and find the [[Ultimate Treasure of Life and Wishes]].

Boards!
# Mushroom Way: This is the easy map of the game. It's just simple. All you have to do is drive in a gorge and hop on mushrooms and land on spaces, But watch out! Mr Flair Mushroom may over-kill you if you land on Bad Luck. He will take all the hearts you have! You will have to fly in a bubble to the end. Be good to see Toad in Toad's Tattoo Roam and pick a tattoo for all of your players!
# Bananas Jungle: Donkey Kong wants you to play Bananas Jungle! There will be a little chaos of banana pile, But hike your way to Banana Ruins to see Donkey Kong in his BIG BATTLE at the end. You also earn bananas, Not hearts. Everything is a banana!
# Triangle Island: Koopa Troopa's map will be the only way to beat up the sun! A just boring thing laying, But still fun to play. You can go by Doris the Loch Ness and get hearts, Or maybe MEGA HEART, With 200 hearts? Try it and find your way of sunny fun!
# Fire Ruins: Wow! Look at this volcano of fire! Can you find a way to figure out? Try out this map and see how good you can do. Be careful! There are fire rings about to hit you. If you are hit, Everyone is out! Is this hard? Is this easy? Will it take 30 hours to do this? Can you do it in the backyard? See what you do.
# Boss Hill: The boss, Bowser, Awaits in this map! It's more harder than last one's. More fire, More traps, And more Bad Luck Spaces. Be careful, Watch out for Bowser Jr and a group of 3 other baddies at the end! If you picked the wrong baddie, You will have to try again!
Games!

Ting-Ling Rings: It's a cat that hops over rings, And you have to do it too! Jump the Wii Remote on the correct colored rings. The player who jumped the most wins!

Dance Party: DJ Noki says you have to dance! Can you dance to the beat, Press the correct buttons Noki says and make sure you have sound on. No music and sounds are playing. Just talking. The player who did all the buttons correct wins!

Doris Ride: Doris wants a ride! Hop on Doris and guide him by loops, rings, danger zones and more and see if you get everything right to win. It's fun, Right?????????????????????????????????

All-Road Tour: 3..2..1..GO! Pick your favorite track and race around it. But look out for the bad stuff.

After coming out of the black hole alive, Liu forget how much old he was, and he thinks is a 15 years old guy.

Because of this fact, Liu easily says &quot;BOREDDDDD&quot; to almost everything when he dont have business to do, instead of doing something usefull.

Also, thinking is a 15 years old, Liu normally acts funny, sometimes imature, sometimes sarcastic but is always happy.

He is also addicted to Electronic things, sometimes bulding machines to do easy work who he could do while he is sleeping or recoloring images.

He also is a bit lazy but is always &quot;OK&quot; for adventures and like the nature.

Luigi is also Liu's brother and try to help luigi when he needs help. Like in Luigi's Mansion, Liu gives tips to luigi and scare ghosts as well.

=== Princess Peach ===
Liu already know how to save Peach in a easy way every time she is kidnapped. He normally screams &quot;AGAIN?!&quot; when she get kidnapped. They act friendly together.

== Role In Games ==
===Super Mario World===
Liu is an unlockable character in Super Mario World.

After completing the Special Zone, an black hole will appear and Liu will jump away from it.

After that, the black hole will vanish, and will appear a dark blue star from it.

Going to this star will make you switch Mario/Luigi to Liu. And going on this star again will make switch Liu to Mario/Luigi.

Same thing for Yoshi's Island non-DS game.

*17th Race: Coconut Mall: 3 Laps, come 1st!
When you arrive back at Toadsworths Garage, he tells you that the engine parts still must be found. Before he can tell you where they are, a team of Paratroopas come down &amp; kidnap him. Before you can act to save him, Bowser Swoops down &amp; knocks you out.

Dry Bowser's Bones get blasted everywhere, but the Cannon couldn't take it. The Baby Luma flys away, &amp; your task is over. But there is still 1 last hope.

Before you can take off in Bowser's Clown Car, the Luma comes &amp; tells you that you cannot take off until you get the next degree, which you have earned...... but the Luma left them sitting on the cannon's edge.
===Part 6===
As you finnally take off in the Clown Car, it breaks down just before it can reach the comet observatory, only to land on Fawdul's Airship.

Cheeky Nando's Mario is another form of [[Mario]], after eating at Nando's.
==Appearance==
When in Cheeky Nando's mode, Mario wears an orange hat and shirt, with red overalls with grey buttons. The orange colour is to represent the cheekiness of the Nando's, whereas the red cheekily connotes Nando's spicy meals. His hat also has the Nando's logo instead of the standard letter &quot;M&quot;. Mario's eyes sometimes change colour and become orange, but only when his meal at Nando's was extra cheeky.
==Personality==
It is a well known fact that Nando's provide top quality cheeky chicken, after eating a Nando's, Mario can get a bit cheeky. When with his friends, Cheeky Nando's Mario is known to have top class banter.
==Abilities==
After eating a piping hot plate of good old Cheeky Nando's, Mario has the ability to create top class banter, which will create a good relationship with the enemies, meaning that they join Mario's side and let him past instead of trying to kill him. What a lad.
==Appearances==
Feel free to release the cheekiness into your own games, and then add them here:
===[[Super Fighting World]]===

Cheeky Nando's Mario appears as an assist in Super Fighting World. He follows the opponents and makes them laugh uncontrollably, providing the summoner a chance to attack.

}}'''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is a platforming title for the [[Nintendo Comet]]. It features the debut of two new ''Mario'' characters, [[Zario]] and [[Zoshi]]. The game features Zario going on a quest to face Zowser after he has infested Zarland with rabid cows. Lucky, Zoshi is able to help Zario tame the rabid cows to assist them in their adventure.
==Story==
Zowser, up to his usual shenanigans, decides to induce his wrath on Zarland for no reason. He goes to his laboratory and implants the rabies virus into a cow. He then rapidly regenerates it, causing an army of rabid cows to appear. He sends them off to Zarland. Meanwhile, Zario is off on a mountainside walk when the rabid cows reach him. He touches the mountain, triggering an avalanche, annihilating some cows. He then hops on a cow and uses his powers of seduction to lure it into his control. He is able to flee, but not before the rabid cows destroy the mountain, causing an implosion which nearly kills Zario. He is left to die, but luckily Zoshi manages to rescue him. By that time, the cows have spread across all of Zarland and the two must defeat them all.
==Gameplay==
The game is a 2D platformer, similar to the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series. Individual aspects of the game are rather similar to the 3D ''Mario'' games, such as ''Super Mario Galaxy'', with special types of jumps and abilities Zario or Zoshi can perform. Levels are much more detailed than simply the world's theme with a few add-ons, having some interesting gameplay features. These include riding rabid cows, which have a variety of functions within the game.

Eyerio is a radioactive being that is very complex, but is absolutely fabulous.
==Description==
===Biography===
{{quote|What the fuck is this|Himself|after seeing {{Username}}}}
Eyerio is a decaclops who is purple for only satan knows why. He isn't even born on a date allowed on Earth, he was born during a rip in space time, and lost there for several years. He became so radioactive that the first person he interacted with, Luigi. Unfortunately, he lost the amount to do this after Luigi became a girl. He has so many eyes that he can see much more of the visible spectrum than normal humans, but still not all colors. He went on a spaceship on a journey to find others like him. Currently, he has only found one, [[Zario]], and they are now in a homosexual relationship as they travel across galaxies searching for more, and are currently engaged. Other than Zario, he has found no one like himself.
===Physical===
{{Quote|Finally, I found another like me|Himself|meeting Zario}}
Eyerio is a human of average size and height. Due to mutation, his skin has been transformed to purple. He wears purple shoes, a pruple shirt and hat, and lime turquoise overalls. His eyes are bright green. He has grown eyes everywhere, and his clothes are made to adjust as such. He looks rather similar to Mario, don't you think?

===Personality===
{{quote|Oh hey, it's {{Username}}. Zario let's kill it and eat it|Himself}}
Eyerio believes that he is perfect. As such, he has very high confidence when facing Eyeser, so he cannot be beaten. He can be rather full of himself at times, though. This can lead to situations that can be particularly testing.

==Abilities==
He has many abilities, including but not limited to:
*Radioactive Mind Blasts
*Thunder
*Seeing in the dark
*Willingly glow in the dark
*Become the dark
*Burning everything
*Jump
*Get
*And many more!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1297">Raphael is [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]]'s long, lost brother that ran away from home only at age of 4. Luigi completely forgot about him and Mario could barely remember. One day, the Mario bros were riding on yoshis to save [[Princess Peach]] once again. They heard slight movement in/near bushes. Luigi got scared and stepped back, Mario was brave and jumped to the bush. &quot;Show Yourself! I will-a-kill you if you don't-a-come out!&quot; Mario yells. Raphael slowly walks out. &quot;M-Mario? Is that actually you bro?&quot; Raphael quietly says. Mario gasps. &quot;Raphael!!! I thought we would never see you again! Or even think of your death! Raphael hugs Mario and jumps on his yoshi. &quot;Alright than, Raphael, Your gonna help-a-us journey and defeat-a-Bowser!&quot; Mario explains happily. And the three bros defeat King [[Bowser]] and Peach meets him.
==Clothes/Extra Info==
Raphael wears a light blue shirt and an 'R' labled hat, Dark blue overalls, brown shoes, and white gloves. He is the shortest and smartest mario brother (but Mario still stands the bravest). Raphael's favorite food is pepperoni pizza and pasta.

Super Mario Universe is a game realeased on the Wii U and is the successor to Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 and due to the time travel in the game, It is both a sequel and are sequel to the original two galaxy games

==Indtroduction==
In the indroduction it explains that Peach dumped Mario for clogging the toilet at Peach's castle with his shit. Although he fixed the clogged toilet since he is a plumber, the bathroom still smelled bad afterward so PEach dumped him. She then married Luigi and that Mario married Prinncess Daisy while Luigi married Princess Peach. It then explained that Luigi and Peach had a daughter who decided to travel back in time using her starship to visit the her mother inthe past. However, suddenly Bowser's fleet of Airships attacked the Starship and stole it's power stars. It then explained that she met with Mario and helped him defeaet Bowsser in Super Mario Galaxy. 

Meanwhile at Koopa Castle, Bowser is planning on how to change history to prevent Rosalina from being born in order to prevent her from travelling back in time and stopping his plan in Super Mario Galaxy. He then realizes that in order to prevent Rosalina from being born, he would have to prevent Luigi and Peach from being married so he would need to prevent Peach from dumping Mario. So he started a rumor that it was Toadsworth not Mario who clogged the toilet with shit, so Peach got angry at Toadsworth and ate him. 

Therefore this created a reality where Rosalina didn't exist so when Bowser attacked in SUper Mario Galaxy, Mario was not given the spin power to stop him and Bowser created a galactic empire with his galaxy generator.

Meanwhile Toad who was spying at Bowser's castle heard about Bowser's plan so he went to tell Mario about it. However it was too late and Toadworth was eaten. Toad got angry that his grandfather was eaten so he got a mega mushroom and murdered Peach in revenge. He then told Mario about Bowser's plan and realized that murdering Peach would prevent her from being able to have Rosalina as a daughter. 

Mario then calls Rosalina on his phone and tells her to drive the starship to the Mushroom Kingdom so that Mario could get on, go back in time, and stop Bowswr from spreading the rumor that Toadsworth clogged the toilet. So she serves and Mario hops on the starship. However Bowser who is told by a Koopa Spy about the Plan, has his airships attack te Starship and blow it up into pieces causing Mario, and Rosalina to fly in different directions.

Mario and Baby Luma end up on a Luma base where there is a Luma who explains that they need to travel through the galaxies were the power stars of Rosalina's starship have been scattered and collect the power stars of Rosalina's starship to put it back together in order to be able to travel back in time. Baby Luma gives Mario the power to spin. They then enter an observatory where they use a launch star to launch to the first galaxy. However Bowser wants to stop Mario from fixing the starship so he sends his minions after him and also to try to prevent him from getting power stars 
==Gameplay==
There are multiple observatory rooms on he Luma Base but at first originally only one is accessible. When entering an observatory, the player can chose a galaxy to launch to using a launch star and each galaxy has a number of stars to collect. The more stars collected, the more galaxies are unlocked. Upon finding a Grand Star in one of the galaxies, a new observatory is unlocked.

|Bowser Jr's Airship Fleet. Upon defeating Bowser Jr, Mario get's a Grand Star and unlocks gets enough stars to get to Bowser's space castle.
|Bowser Jr
|}
===Bowser's Space Castle===
Upon defeating Bowser Jr, Mario unblocks the final observatory, who's launch star takes him to Bowser's castle where Rosalina has has been kidnapped. The castle is full with all sorts of traps such as fire, lava, and thwomps. After getting through the level, Mario battles Bowser and defeats him and get's the final grand star and frees Rosalina.
===Final Boss===
After Mario gets the final grand star, and frees Rosalina they use the power of the power stars snd grandstars to convert the Luma base into what looked like Rosalina's Starship. They then used the ship and travelled back in time to the Mushroom Kingdom at the time when Bowser went back in time.

To prevent Bowser from spreading rumors that Toadworth clogged the Toilet they try to destroy the time machine and kill Bowser using power ups. Bowser comes out of the machine injured but he grabs Rosalina's wand and uses it to remove the power stars from the starship and absorb all of them making him grow to the size of Godzilla. Mario grabs a mega Mushroom and battles Bowser with his fist and legs. Bowser is eventually defeated and he sneezes out all the power stars making them to back to Rosalina's starship. He idmediatly shrinks back to his normal size and tries to run away but Mega Mario grabs Bowser and eats him. 

This causes history to change back to what it was before and Rosalina is born in the figure. This causes her to travel back in time to Super Mario Galaxy and help Mario defeat Bowser in Super Mario Galaxy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="293">'''Poo Mario''' is Mario after eating a [[Poo Mushroom]]. It allows him to gross out enemies, due to his bad smell. His main power, though, is pooping on enemies. He can also duck and pretend he is just a pile of dog shit on the grass.

&lt;center&gt;if you support trump, you need to carry that weight. if you voted for one issue, whether it be your view on abortion or obamacare or whatever and ignored all the hateful shit he did, you need to realize you carry the weight of getting the man elected and ALL that he stands for. i do not have to feel sympathetic. i do not have to necessarily &quot;respect&quot; your opinion. own up to it and help your friends who are now suffering because of trump.&lt;/center&gt;

''I'm '''EXOTORO'''. I am a '''WOMAN'''. Check out my stuff [[User:Exotoro/Portfolio|here]]. I would describe myself as laid back as ala carte, and hard-working, probably working on thirty projects at a time. Typically I'm the easiest gal to work with in terms of projects but I like to be very hands-on. Most of my characters are free to use but I probably will go in and correct their characterization.''

'''WHAT AM I WORKING ON?'''

Currently working on a lot of projects at once. Some will succeed while others will fail. There is no update schedule to any of them and they might go weeks without updates.
*Breath of Yesterday (Lapis story)
*A Flash Beorn Our Eyes (Fantendo Now episode)
*Days of Victory (the culmination of all my New Fantendoverse content)
*Early stages of The Corset, The Ring, The Bones (Shapeshifter Part 2, on lapis, in my google drive)
*First Day (Fighters Club Extraordinaire episode 2, on lapis, in progress occasionally)
*New Fantendoverse characters (A22 Woman, &quot;Save the Day&quot;)
*Crow vs the World (Slowly and lowly)
*Fantendo Smash Bros. Victory (Let's just finish up the roster)
*Super Mario: Elemental Journey (yeah, possibly)
*Pokemon Cobalt and Crimson (expect a lot more over the month long break from college)

INFORMATION ON THESE AVATARS: These avatars have multiple sources behind them. The first is a overlaying of the Minecraft Exoverse Mod pack logo and an album art of the Arcade Fire album &quot;Reflektor&quot;. This pretty remains the same, with the crown in the second one being added onto it (which comes from Kingdom Hearts and is based off the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 cover). The rest of the avatars have a background of something else and that changes a lot.
*Third one is Kingdom Hearts 1.5.
*Fourth one is King of Fighters XIV.
*Fifth one is Adventure Time.
*Sixth is Neo Geo Battle Colosseum.
*Seventh is a picture of Argon, a gas.
*Eighth is Glitch Mob's Love Death Immortality cover.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3651">''Paper Mario: Phelt Finders ''is the last Paper Mario game in the Sticker Star series because it is going downfall, and there are too many shitty Sticker Star 3s here.

== Plot ==
Bowser steals Peach again, that's just it. Huey returns as Mario's partner because Kersti is annoying as fuck.

== Enemies ==
(Nintendo decided to add some other basic Mario enemies instead of just Shitty Generic Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Shy Guys, etc)
* Goomba
* Koopa Troopa
* Shy Guy
* Cheep Cheep
* Cheep Chomp
* Dry Bones
* Urchin
* Spiny
* Lakitu
* Thwomp
* Whomp
* Blooper
* Sushie
* Fire Bubble
* Bullet Bill
* Bill Blaster
* Choppah (the dino enemy in Galaxy 2, not that fucking annoying bug thing in SPM)
* Piranha Plant
* Spike
* Hammer Bro
* Fire Bro
* Boomerang Bro
* Wiggler
* Monty Mole
* Boo
* Chargin Chuck
* Scuttlebug
* Magikoopa
* Topman
* Rex
* Topmini
* Spiky Topman
* Spiny Hermit
* Octoomba
* Fizzlit
* Twirlip
* Smeech
* Flipbug
* Cluckboom
* Crabber
* Digga
* Broozer
* Flaptack
* Amp
* Cataquack
* Mandibug
* Octopus
* Undergrunt
* Buzzy Beetle
* Chain Chomp
* Pokey
* Swoop
* Porcupuffer

== Chapters ==
(Nintendo even made unique locations instead of Grass, Desert, Water, Forest wIth Poison water, mountain, cloud, ice, and Lava locations)

World 1: Toad City (A city in the plains, surrounded by mountains, their inhabitants are pretty obvious by the name of the location though)

World 2: Roxico (A really rocky place, a desert with really hard sand inhabited by the Skeletons from Super Mario Odyssey)

World 3: Garden Land (A really large garden in the middle of the ocean, inhabited by the Whittles)

World 4: Space Galaxy (It's Outer Space, just with no Squirps, but there are Lumas and Rosalina though)

World 5: New Donk City (The city from Super Mario Odyssey! Humans live there, which is odd though. I am also gonna say Sonic 6 for no reason at all)

World 6: Island Delfino (Welcome back to Super Mario Sunshine. Piantas live in Island Delfino. Prepare to find F.L.U.D.D again)

World 7: Sprixie Kingdom (The Kingdom from Super Mario 3D World inhabited by the Sprixies themselves, obviously, also, Bowser's Place is the next world)

World 8: Bowser's Fortress (Bowser decided to &quot;unique-afy&quot; his Castle a bit, now lava pools are replaced with Dark Matter, Paint has been splattered on the walls, making it look like a total mess, and Bowser got himself his Clown Car now. He didn't have it since Sticker Star)

== Bosses ==
(The Bosses too, have been &quot;unique-afied)
# Larry Koopa
# Petey Piranha
# Bowser. Jr
# Whomp Army (Atleast their personality are unique)
# Roy Koopa
# Giant Paragoomba (Again, like the Whomp Army, personality is unique)
# Shy Guy Captain (Who looks like a regular Shy Guy to avoid originality)
# Squizzard (He's back!)
# Iggy Koopa
# Boom Boom
# Kamek
# Wendy Koopa
# Pom Pom
# Dino Piranha
# Tarantox
# King Kaliente
# Bouldergeist
# Major Burrows
# Topmaniac
# Lemmy Koopa
# Peewee Piranha
# Gooper Blooper
# Tower Power Pokey (He's back from Sticker Star with a personality this time)
# Gringill
# Eely-Mouth
# Morton Koopa
# Whomp King
# Prince Pikante
# Bugaboom
# King Bob-Omb
# Ludwig Koopa
# Bowser
# Big Broozer
# Megaleg
# Baron Brrr
# Motley Bossblob
# Gobblegut
# Dry Bowser
# Shadow Mario
# Kamella
# King Boo
# Hisstocrat
# Mega Paper Bowser

== Trivia ==
* This is likely the last Paper Mario: Shitty Star I'm gonna make.
* It's so original.
* &quot;Doge&quot;

} 
Five Minutes at Hank Hill's, or &quot;FMAHH&quot; is a game for the nintendo wii u, nintendo wii, playstation 1-4 and xbox two and the nintendo ds (but not the nintendo 3ds). 

== Story ==
One day, Bobby Hill overhears his dad, Hank Hill, talking about propane, which Hank Hill is overly obsessed with. Bobby walks up to Hank, and says &quot;I really get annoyed about you going so blah blah blah about gas. I mean, its not even cool! Why do you think its a lady and you always treat it better than my mom?&quot; Hank gets really ticked off and prepares to kick Bobby's ass, but Bobby gets away just in time. He then runs into his room and hides. He finds his gameboy and puts in the &quot;Camera&quot; cartridge. A picture of the alley is on the screen, and he realizes that Hank is still trying to kick his ass!

== Gameplay ==
Basically, you are in Bobby's room, and you have a gameboy. The gameboy can check cameras. The cameras are the Alley (Where Hank and the guys start), Garage, Back Porch, Kitchen, Hallway, Bedroom, The Den, Living Room, Basement and Back Window. You have to check the cameras to make sure they aren't coming to kick your ass. You have a flashlight and you can click on your door to make sure they aren't at the door. However, there isn't actually a closeable door. However, if they are at your door they'll jump at you in 5 seconds, so you have to quickly turn around, open the window behind you, and then when they jumpscare you, in the middle of the jumpscare press E, and you'll duck, sending them out the window. The only one this doesn't work on is Dale, who comes from the back window to balance it out so you don't always have the window open,  but no other guy will come while Dale is at the back window. When Dale is there, you have to close the window obviously. You have to survive five minutes in the office. If you die, you'll get a scene where Hank is screaming to Bobby &quot;YOUR A LOSER! A LOSER YOU HEARD ME?!?!&quot;

== Guys ==

=== Hank Hill === 
The equivalent to Freddy from FNAF. Starts in the Alley, then goes to the garage, to the hallway, and finally to the door to kick some ass. Doesn't move until the 3rd minute, and then he is the most agressive of them all. His jumpscare is jumping at you, screaming BWAAAAAAH loudly. He requires constant watching on the cameras. You know if he moves if you can hear him saying &quot;I'm going to kick your ass!&quot;

=== Boomhaur ===
The equivalent to Bonnie from FNAF. Starts in the Alley, then the Back Porch, to the Kitchen, to the Backroom, to the bedroom, the hallway and finally your door. His jumpscare is jumping at you saying &quot;Y'know man, Hank wants us to kick ass man&quot;. He is more aggressive than Bill, but isn't as much as Hank, and doesn't require as much watching, but is the first to leave the alley. 

=== Bill Dauterive ===
The least agressive &quot;guy&quot; and equivalent to Chica from FNAF. Starts in the Alley, then to the Garage, then the Kitchen, to the Living Room, to the Back Porch, to The Den, then to the hallway, to the door. Jumpscare is making nonsense noises while jumping at you.

=== Dale Gribble ===
The 2nd most aggressive &quot;guy&quot; and the only one without a FNAF equivalent. Starts in the Alley hiding in a cooler, then goes to the back porch, and then the back window. Jumpscare is shooting poison and then saying &quot;Exterminator&quot;

=== Kahn ===
If you check the back window too much, Kahn appears in the window. When you put the game boy down, Kahn is sitting in your office saying &quot;Haha, Rednecks!&quot; he then crashes the game.

== Reviews ==
10/10 too much hank ~IGN

It is a Five Nights at Freddys styled game except hardcore as hell. You play as a security guard named &quot;Senpai&quot;.
==Animatronics==
*Illuminati
The main animatronic in the game and by far, the most MLG. Hes to busy 420 noscoping so he mostly doesn't move unless he rages hard. He starts on the Scope Stage.
*Doritos
The most delicous animatronic in the game that is very active because you ate one dorito. wtf m8. He starts on the Scope Stage.
*Mountain Dew
The turn up animatronic. He is also very active because you took a sip. wou, u pay nou. He starts on the Scope Stage
*Gabe Newell
He is always hiding behind a curtain, because he is giving his press conference. If you don't check the camera he will run though the halls until he reaches your office and noscopes you, because Gabe likes being watched and you didn't watch him.
*Semi-Silver Illuminati
This guy will crashe your game because he fucking wants to. Deal with it.
==Locations==
*Scope Stage
*COD area
*Crack stage
*Alone closet 
*West nerd
*East nerd
*Bathroom

'''NOTE: this is a joke game'''

'''Five Nights at Freddy's 2.5''' is the ??? game in the ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' series. It has new animatronics, new areas, and is set in a funfair. You have set up a camp at a roller coaster which was abandoned, and have to survive 5 nights. Also, don't forget to drink mountain dew every once in a while. It's so you don't dehydrate to much, right? Or is it.... *x-files theme plays* Oh, yeah, and you also got a dorito. Your favourite type in this game, so you don't starve. Did I forgot you brought a meme calculator here?

'''Five Freddy Nights 2: The Quickening''' is a prequel to the critically acclaimed [[Five Freddy Nights]]. It explains how... uh... it really doesn't explain anything.
==Plot==
A guy named Jim is working at a pizza place and then some weird robots show up and try to kill him, but John Connors appears to recruit him for the anti-robot resistance to stop them.
==Animatronics==
*Freddy Fazduck - It's Freddy Fazdolphin's father, you see... it's a PREQUEL now...
*A Jumpscare - ''uh oh this games gettin' pretty spoooooky you guys...''
*Balloon Boy
*Balloon Man
*Balloon Girl
*Balloon Woman
*Balloon Cat
*Balloon Dog
*Balloon Fish
*Balloon Tyrannosaurus Rex
==Building Layout==
[[File:Office.png|thumb|332px|center]]

==Gameplay==
You have a camera you can look at to see the monsters and play audio to lure them away from you. You have a Freddy Mask that protects you from monsters. You have a flashlight that scares away the monsters. You have perfume that prevents the monsters from tracking your scent. You have a system power thingy you need to balance out by using lights and doors and camera as little as possible. You have a health bar that goes down every few seconds. You refill your health bar by winding a music box. Whenever the music box stops your health goes down again. Also, when the music box is off the monsters go after you. You also have a rubber ducky you need to squeak every few seconds or else the building will catch fire. When the building catches fire you must close the doors and seal the vents and do a system reboot. Every now and then the building's air goes off and you need to turn the air back on before you suffocate to death. You need to also turn the electricity generators back on every few seconds because they go out by themselves every minute and as they are off you are vulnerable to attacks. You also need to spin around in your office chair every few seconds to prevent yourself from dying of boredom.

It's ''simple.''
==Reception==
My friend Tom thought it was pretty cool.
==Legacy==
it had none.

It has a seventy-five out of three rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Tom McTom, a world renown video game reviewer, said in his review &quot;It's good&quot;. Many FNAF fans said &quot;its good becuz animatronic and controls and its great I love it&quot;.

{{FNAF Infobox}}
'''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is an indie point-and-click survival horror video game developed by [[Scott Cawthon]]. The goal is for the player to survive five nights at [[Freddy Fazbear's Pizza]] while avoiding getting caught and [[Deaths|killed]] by the [[Animatronics|animatronic]] characters, and tracking their movements via the restaurant's [[Monitor|security cameras]]. On November 11, 2014, the second game was released onto Steam. On March 2, 2015, the third game was released onto Steam. A fourth game was released on July 23, 2015 and is the final installment in the ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' series. Then, on December 17, 2015, a [[Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes|novel]] based on the story was released onto Amazon. A spinoff role-playing game, entitled ''FNAF World'', is currently in development and scheduled for February 19, 2016.

== Summary ==
Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see!

The main attraction is [[Freddy Fazbear]], of course, and his [[Bonnie|two]] [[Chica|friends]]. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds!

The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night, however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small [[The Office|office]] you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of [[Power Indicator|electricity]] that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night — no more security [[doors]] and no more [[Hall Lights|lights]]! If something isn't right — namely, if Freddy Fazbear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!

Can you survive Five Nights at Freddy's?
&lt;!--This is the OFFICIAL SUMMARY from the Steam page. DO NOT MODIFY IN ANY WAY. http://store.steampowered.com/app/319510--&gt;
&lt;!--Yes, we know that this summary is against the rules of the wiki, especially pertaining to the &quot;third-person&quot; and &quot;neutral perspective&quot; rules on this wiki, but it is still the official summary nonetheless.--&gt;

== Gameplay ==
[[File:2014-08-29_00003.jpg|thumb|left|The Main Menu]]The player sits in an office and monitors security cameras positioned throughout the restaurant to observe the animatronic mascots. The player has a limited amount of power to view camera feeds, light hallways, and close the doors on either side of them.

The player must use the camera feed locations in the building and hold the animatronics off using the doors. If the player fails to do this, they will be jumpscared and receive a ''Game Over''. To advance to the next night, the player must survive from 12:00 AM until 6:00 AM (8 minutes and 37 seconds in real-time, 4 minutes 30 seconds on mobile edition).

The four animatronics that the player must avoid are the titular Freddy Fazbear and his three friends: [[Bonnie]] the Bunny, [[Chica]] the chicken, and [[Foxy]] the Pirate (a broken-down animatronic which is no longer in use, but becomes active during the night). There is an additional animatronic known as [[Golden Freddy]], who only appears when the player experiences a paranoid [[Hallucinations|hallucination]].

== Reception ==
''Five Nights at Freddy's'' received positive reviews from critics. Indie Game Magazine praised ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' for its simple take on the horror genre, noting &lt;!---This word is not supposed to be &quot;Nothing&quot;, so please don't change it.---&gt; that its artistic direction and gameplay mechanics contributed to a feeling of &quot;brutal tension&quot; — worsened by how a player may be familiar with similar restaurants such as ''Chuck E. Cheese's'', and that &quot;it's an incredibly terrifying experience to try to save yourself from the single jump scare that ends the game.&quot; In conclusion, ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' was considered a &quot;fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying.&quot; However, the game was criticized for taking too long to load when launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiegamemag.com/five-nights-at-freddys-review-nightmares-and-death-at-chuck-e-cheeses/ Indie Game Magazine's review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Omri Petitte for PC Gamer gave ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' a score of 80 out of 100&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcgamer.com/five-nights-at-freddys-review/ PC Gamer's review]&lt;/ref&gt;, commenting that the game took a &quot;less-is-more&quot; approach to its design, and that while &quot;the AI isn't some masterwork of procedural unpredictability,&quot; it would &quot;[still] head straight to you and eat your face off, or it'll play around like an innocent child before closing in for the kill. Your mind will fill in the rest.&quot; The game's overall atmosphere was praised for emphasizing the fear and suspense of an approaching threat, rather than the arrival of the threat itself, as executed in other horror-oriented games. However, the gameplay of ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' was criticized for becoming repetitive once a player masters it, as there is &quot;not much more to expect beyond managing battery life and careful timing of slamming doors shut, so those with steely willpower won't find anything else past the atmosphere of it all.&quot; Ryan Bates of Game Revolution gave the game a 4.5 out of 5; comparing its camera-oriented gameplay to the 1992 game ''[[wikipedia:Night Trap|Night Trap]]'', he praised the game's minimalistic presentation (with particular emphasis on its audio design and lack of music) for contributing to the terror of the game, along with the fact that the &quot;nervous impulses&quot; of its repetitive gameplay would &quot;[reach] almost OCD-type levels, adding to the tense environment.&quot; In conclusion, he felt that the game was &quot;horror done right,&quot; but that it was too short.

''&lt;nowiki&gt;Eurogamer'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s Jeffrey Matulef compared the animatronic animals in the game to Weeping Angels — predatory creatures from the universe of ''Doctor Who'' — due to their ability to only move when they are not being observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-19-five-nights-at-freddys-brings-horrifying-animatronic-animals-to-steam Five Nights at Freddy's brings horrifying animatronic animals to Steam]. ''[[wikipedia:Eurogamer|Eurogamer]]''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Softpedia'' gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Cosmin Anton noting that it &quot;drifts away from the classic first-person horror survival titles,&quot; but that the &quot;inability to move combined with the limited power available will make you feel quite helpless in front of those relentless robots that just want to share a bit of their 'love' with you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://games.softpedia.com/get/Games-Demo/Five-Nights-at-Freddy-s.shtml Five Nights at Freddy's Review]. ''[[wikipedia:Softpedia|Softpedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile Version ==
: ''Main article: [[Five Nights at Freddy's (Mobile)]]''

On August 25 and September 11 of 2014, ports of ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' were released for Android and iOS devices respectively. While the premise of the game remained the same, gameplay is slightly different, due to the use of a touch screen rather than a mouse. The behavior of the animatronics is also altered in order to balance the time reduction within the mobile version of the game.

== Updates ==
=== v1.13 ===
[[File:Thethirdstar.jpg|thumb|260px|Scott Cawthon confirming the third star for beating 20/20/20/20 mode.]]
'''Version 1.13 ''' was an update for the game that was released on August 19th. The update fixed minor bugs and added a few small things.
* On the [[Custom Night]], inputting the A.I.'s levels to 1-9-8-7 will cause [[Golden Freddy]]'s death scene to happen instantly, crashing the game. This was added by Scott, the developer, to halt rumors about entering 1/9/8/7 into the A.I. settings to get an alternate ending.
* Beating the Custom Night with the A.I. levels set to [[Custom Night#Special Input Codes|20/20/20/20]] will now give the player the third and final star on the title screen.
=== v1.131 ===
'''Version 1.131''' was a very minor update to the Steam version.
* Changed phone number on the Help Wanted ad from 1-888-FAZ FAZBEAR to 1-555-FAZ-FAZBEAR.
===Halloween Update===
*Adds a jack-o-lantern to the desk and decorative lights to the office when the player's computer date is set to 10/31.

=== 2015 ===
*On January 16, 2015, ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' won three FEAR awards by user choice. &lt;ref&gt;http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3324839/fear-awards-best-worst-horror-games-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;
*On April 2015, Warner Bros. purchased the rights to adapt the game into a feature film. &lt;ref&gt;http://kotaku.com/hollywood-is-planning-a-five-nights-at-freddys-movie-1696356202&lt;/ref&gt;
*On November 2015, the game was included for the ''Five Nights at Freddy's Franchise Pack (1-4)'' that can be downloaded from [http://store.steampowered.com/sub/80443/ here]. The bundle costs $24.99.

== Trivia ==
*Interestingly, all that is in the game files is the executable, although it is possible to access the game files with Clickteam Fusion 2.5., the program ''Five Night's at Freddy's'' was made with.
*The game itself was inspired by the game ''Chipper &amp; Sons Lumber Co.'', also made by Scott Cawthon. Many players of the game criticized it because of the graphics, which, according to them, looked like 'animatronics'. Scott possibly used that criticism to make ''Five Nights at Freddy's''.
*When Scott released the first gameplay video of ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' on his channel, the game seemed to be much more pixelated. On the starting screen, the video also showed a graphic of a man with the number 1 next to it, which shows that at one point in development, the player would have had limited lives.
*Even though there is no specified year in which the game takes place, many have assumed that it takes place around 1993, as the paycheck at the end of the game matches the minimum wage of the time.
*In the first game, the newspaper article shown in the intro sequence misspells &quot;pizzeria&quot; as &quot;pizzaria&quot;.
*The concept of ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' is similar to that of the 2006 comedy film, ''Night at the Museum''. In both stories, the attractions act as expected during the day (the animatronics entertaining the guests, and the museum exhibits staying still), come to life during the night, and both protagonists are night guards who work for security at the establishments.
*''Five Nights at Freddy's'' is the only game in the series to have a Display Resolution Support of 16:9, the sequels only have 4:3.
**However, All the mobile versions are natively 16:9.
**This is one possible reason why The Offices from the second and third game and The Bedroom in the fourth game look stretched in the Mobile versions.
*Scott once joked in a steam post that a sequel &quot;''Freddy in Space''&quot; was slated for a April 2016 release. The post can be found at this [http://steamcommunity.com/app/388090/discussions/0/494631967659044194/#p2 link].

==Usage==
Use
&lt;pre&gt;
{{User|YOUR NAME HERE|A NICKNAME}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
The second parameter is optional. So &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User|Lumoshi}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; would show {{User|Lumoshi}} while &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User|Lumoshi|That Epic Luma}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; would show {{User|Lumoshi|That Epic Luma}}.
